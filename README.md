## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I hope to explore the information that hides in the dataset, for example, by analyzing the dataset, I can find out that who has the most songs that made in the hot 100 over a year, and which song is the most trending song in the certain time period, etc. The Billboard Hot 100 is the music industry standard record chart in the United States for songs, published weekly by Billboard magazine. Chart rankings are based on sales, radio play, and online streaming in the United States. It is based on the real database to create the chart, and that is why the majority of my favorite songs comes from this chart. These songs are more likely to be accepted and loved, and that is why I am interested in it.
## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

My dataset is “The Hot 100” songs from the Bilboard. Billboard is an American music and entertainment magazine published weekly by the Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group, a division of MRC Media & Info. The magazine provides music charts, news, video, opinion, reviews, events, and style related to the music industry. Its music charts include the Hot 100, Billboard 200 and Global 200, tracking the most popular albums and songs in different genres of music. My data specially focuses on the most popular 100 songs that were trending on sales and airplay for that week. This dataset is a collection of all "The Hot 100" charts released since its inception in 1958, which is a very large dataset, therefore I’m considering to cut it down to the recent 10 to 5 years. The purpose of the hot 100 songs is to show the world that what kinds of music is the trend, and share them to the people who loves and enjoys music. It is also a motivation to the creators.
